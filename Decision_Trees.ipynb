    "- Here a statistical test(chi-square test) is applied to determine if the split on a feature is statistically significant. Here the null hypothesis is that the actual and predicted values are independent and then a significant test is used to determine if the null hypothesis can be accepted or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The significant test computes the probability that the same or more extreme value of the statistic will occur by chance if the null hypothesis is correct. This is called the $p-value$ of the test and if this value is too low, null hypothesis can be rejected. For this the observed $p-value$ is compared with that of a significance level $\\alpha$ which is fixed.\n",
